This repository demonstrates a common error in JavaScript related to type coercion during arithmetic operations. The `bug.js` file shows the unexpected behavior when adding a number and a string using the `+` operator. The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version that uses `parseInt()` to ensure both operands are numbers before performing addition.
